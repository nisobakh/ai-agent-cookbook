ai-agent-cookbook
Prompt and agent workflow experiments using Python.

Overview  
This project explores basic multi-agent coordination and prompt routing concepts.  
Each agent performs a specialized function, simulating lightweight automation flows between product, finance, and support use cases.

Features  
- Modular agent and router structure  
- Role-based task handling  
- Simulated multi-agent responses  
- Easily extensible for new workflows  

Tools  
Python • Prompt Design • Multi-Agent Logic  

Example  
The sample script demonstrates a router assigning tasks to different agents  
(Finance, Sales, Support) based on the text query.
